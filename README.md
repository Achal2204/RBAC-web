Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Application
This project is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built using React.js and JSON Server. It allows for role-based authentication and authorization, enabling different views and functionalities for Admin and User roles. The application includes features like user and role management, dynamic permissions, and secure login.

Features
User Management

Prevent inactive users from logging in.
Role Management

Assign permissions (Read, Write, Delete) to roles dynamically.
Permissions dictate access to features like Add Spots, Explore, and Delete Spots.
Authentication & Authorization
Secure login with hashed passwords (using bcryptjs).
Differentiated dashboards for Admin and User roles.
Unauthorized users are restricted with appropriate alerts.
Spot Management
Add, view, and delete tourist spots.
Manage spots based on role-specific permissions.

All data (users, roles, spots) is managed via JSON Server.
